# Art Style Transformer

Transform any photo into the style of a master painter using AI analysis and canvas-based pixel processing.

## Painters included
- Pablo Picasso — Cubism
- Leonardo da Vinci — Renaissance / Sfumato
- Vincent van Gogh — Post-Impressionism
- Claude Monet — Impressionism
- Salvador Dalí — Surrealism
- Gustav Klimt — Art Nouveau

## How it works
1. Upload any image
2. Select a painter
3. The app applies pixel-level style transformations (colour shifts, brushstroke overlays, warp distortions, edge detection)
4. Claude AI analyses the image and explains which techniques were applied and why

## Tech stack
- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Canvas API for image processing
- Anthropic Claude API for AI analysis

## Local development
Just open `index.html` in a browser — no build step needed.
